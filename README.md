# Products.CompositePack
CompositePack is a product that allows a user to build composite pages by manually aggregating Archetype-based content from his site. It features a WYWIWYG user interface that provides drag-n-drop positioning of content on the page.

This is a very old product for Plone, and has been depricated in favor of plone.app.mosaic https://github.com/plone/plone.app.mosaic
